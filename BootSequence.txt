1. When compute switched on or reset, it runs through a sseries of diagnostics called POST - "Power On Self Test".
2. BOIS loads bootable devices only if it sees magic number "0x55 0xAA" at byte 510 and 510 on the bootable device.
3. BOIS always loads the OS at address 0x7C00 and it may be refered as CS:IP 0x0000:0x7C00 or 0x07C0:0x0000. Both are same.

TIP: always set CS:IP yourself as soon as Bootloader loads. So it will not confuse you.

4. CPU always boots in "Real Mode".

TIP: never think all the register at this point contains 0 value they might have some garbage values as well.

5. Then bootloader loads kernal into mermoy and passes control to it.
